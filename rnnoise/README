RNNoise is a noise suppression library based on a recurrent neural network.
A description of the algorithm is provided in the following paper:

================

The material put into piHPDSR is meant as a minimal model for the ease of the user,
it is generally recommended to use "installed" versions of RNNoise compiled
with CPU-specific optimisations etc.

The code copied here comes from

https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise.git

A "Makefile" has been provided that just compiles the files needed with standard
optimisation levels.

Since the file src/rnnoise_data.c (80 MByte) is larger that the recommended
maximum file size in github (50 MByte), it has been split into two parts.
